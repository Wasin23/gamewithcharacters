# this project will be a way for me to practice my code.
# It will build upon itself
# I want to create a game of life with multiple characters that move around and make decisions
# The world will have natural disasters as well

# TODO LIST
# create fire using BFS: DONE
# Create earthquake using DFS:
# sliding window algo for snow / heat:
# Character memories for previous x positions to skew movement towards something, assigned to self.positions:
# Potential disaster zone rescue (shortest path):
# Food / resources:

# use DSA for complex character movement, assignment of traits, and other environmental factors
# Have the list print every second with updates

# Currently, new characters are given random positions on the map, added to a dict, and then the dict is written to a characters file
# The characters file is retrieved on each startup
# Old characters that are not initialized persist despite not being initialized as the app pulls from what exists (in get_stats()) first
